## 10/9/2023 
I was successful in the physics exam, I can almost do all the exams, except the collision topic, in which I lack some knowledge.  However, the thing I should improve on is my time management in the afternoon and at night. I should control my nap time in the afternoon which to day I waste much timeâ€”and planning to read and review content at night. Though today I wasted a lot of time, but I am still working on my plan, I read the three-body problem novel for 1 hour and reviewed some content for tomorrow's exams. Tomorrow I will wake up early, make some coffee, write the daily morning, and review knowledge before noon. I will have eaten a meal before going to the exam. When The exam is complete, I will go to the dormitory to review discrete math content with no nap.

## Complete almost the worst 4/9/2023
This day I failed in every plan, I didn't finish any plan. This morning I used too much brain to study calculus, and then I was impressionable to my friend left me, I used valuable time to sleep at lunch. I used time waste to study discrete math and play with other things together, which made me a bad studying. Ultimately, I didn't have enough courage to ask out the project that I see it's not my life target, I used more time to prepare my mind. All of this made me fail in everything. It's sad to accept, but all of this is my bad.
